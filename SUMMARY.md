# Summary of Changes to main.ts

## Key Improvements

1. **Removed redundant code** between main function and DOMContentLoaded event listener
2. **Added proper error handling** for unresolved functions
3. **Improved code organization** with helper functions and better structure
4. **Fixed issues with unresolved functions**:
   - Added checks for `activateExtension` method existence
   - Implemented fallback to `activateById` when available
   - Added safe property access for `isActive`
5. **Resolved timing issues with extension registration**:
   - Implemented retry mechanism for finding extensions
   - Added configurable retry count and delay between attempts
   - Testing confirmed extensions are typically available on the second attempt

## Testing Results

The improved code was tested and successfully:
- Finds the Kotlin extension after a short delay
- Activates the extension using the fallback method
- Creates the editor with Kotlin syntax highlighting
- Provides detailed logging throughout the process

## Testing Instructions

To test the changes:

```bash
cd extension-test
npm run dev
```

Check the console output for errors and verify the editor loads correctly.
