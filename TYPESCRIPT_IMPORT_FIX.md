# TypeScript Import Error Fix

## Issue Description

The main.ts file was experiencing TypeScript errors with the message "TS2307: Cannot find module" for several imports. This document explains the cause of these errors and the solution implemented.

## Root Causes

The errors were caused by several factors:

1. **Missing Type Definitions for Vite-specific Imports**: 
   - Worker imports with the `?worker` suffix (e.g., `monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker?worker`)
   - VSIX file imports (e.g., `../../extension/vscode-kotlin-0.2.37-web.vsix`)

2. **Side-effect Imports Without Type Definitions**:
   - The import of `vscode/localExtensionHost` which doesn't export anything but has side effects

3. **Deep Imports from Monaco VSCode API**:
   - Imports from deep paths like `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api/vscode/src/vs/platform/extensions/common/extensions`

## Solution

A type declaration file (`vite-env.d.ts`) was created to provide TypeScript with the necessary type information for these imports:

1. **Worker Import Definitions**:
   - Added a generic type definition for all `*?worker` imports
   - Added specific type definitions for each Monaco editor worker import

2. **VSIX Import Definition**:
   - Added a type definition for `*.vsix` imports

3. **Side-effect Import Definition**:
   - Added a type definition for `vscode/localExtensionHost`

4. **Deep Import Definitions**:
   - Added a type definition for `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api/vscode/src/vs/platform/extensions/common/extensions`
   - Included the `ExtensionIdentifier` class that's imported in main.ts

## How It Works

The type declaration file tells TypeScript about the structure of these modules, allowing it to properly type-check the code without generating errors. For example:

- For worker imports, it defines them as constructor functions that create new Worker instances
- For the VSIX import, it defines it as a module that exports a default value
- For side-effect imports, it defines an empty module
- For deep imports, it provides the necessary class and interface definitions

## Recommendations for Future Development

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Use Type Declaration Files for Non-standard Imports**:
   - Always create type declaration files for imports that use bundler-specific syntax (like Vite's `?worker` suffix)
   - Place these in a `src/types` directory or directly in the `src` directory with a `.d.ts` extension

2. **Avoid Deep Imports When Possible**:
   - Try to import from the package's public API rather than from deep internal paths
   - If deep imports are necessary, document them and provide type definitions

3. **Keep TypeScript Configuration Up to Date**:
   - Ensure `moduleResolution` in tsconfig.json is appropriate for your bundler (e.g., "bundler" for Vite)
   - Include necessary type references (e.g., `/// <reference types="vite/client" />`)

4. **Consider Using Import Aliases**:
   - Define import aliases in tsconfig.json or vite.config.js to simplify complex import paths
   - This can make the code more maintainable and less prone to path resolution issues
