# Browser Console Redirection to Terminal

## Issue Description

The browser console output was not appearing in the terminal when running the development server. This made it difficult to debug JavaScript errors that occur in the browser.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we identified several potential causes:

1. **Timing Issues**: Console logs in the browser might be executed before the console redirection plugin has fully initialized.
2. **Script Injection Issues**: The plugin might not be properly injecting the script that overrides console methods.
3. **Network Issues**: There might be CORS or other network-related issues preventing the logs from being sent to the server.
4. **Server Middleware Issues**: The server middleware might not be properly handling the console log requests.

## Changes Made

We made the following changes to address the issue:

1. **Fixed Timing Issues**:
   - Modified `main.ts` to move test console logs inside a Promise chain after the main application has initialized
   - Added a 2-second delay using `setTimeout` to ensure the console redirection plugin has time to initialize
   - Added clear markers at the beginning and end of test logs to make them more visible

2. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Added more detailed logging to the console-redirect-plugin.js file
   - Added logging for plugin initialization, script injection, and server middleware
   - Added client-side logging for network requests

3. **Created Simplified Test Environment**:
   - Created a standalone test HTML file with buttons to trigger different types of console logs
   - Created a simple server script to handle console redirection
   - Created a console redirection script that can be used independently of Vite

## How to Use Console Redirection

The console redirection feature is now properly configured and should work when running the development server. Here's how to use it:

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/sven/WebstormProjects/vsix-extension-example/extension-test
   NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run dev
   ```

2. **Look for Console Redirection Indicators**:
   When the server starts, you should see messages like:
   ```
   Console Redirect Plugin Initialized at [timestamp]
   Transforming HTML to inject console redirection script
   Configuring server middleware for console redirection
   Console Redirection Active Browser logs will appear in this terminal
   ```

3. **Interact with the Application**:
   As you interact with the application in the browser, any console logs should appear in the terminal with appropriate formatting and color coding.

4. **Check for Errors**:
   If you encounter JavaScript errors in the browser, they will be highlighted in red in the terminal with full stack traces.

## Troubleshooting

If console logs still don't appear in the terminal:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look at the browser's developer tools console to see if there are any errors related to the console redirection script.

2. **Check Network Requests**: In the browser's developer tools, check the Network tab to see if requests are being made to the `/__console_redirect` endpoint.

3. **Try the Simplified Test Environment**: Use the simplified test environment to isolate and debug console redirection issues:
   ```bash
   cd /home/sven/WebstormProjects/vsix-extension-example/extension-test
   node test-server.js
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and use the buttons to trigger different types of console logs.

4. **Increase Debug Level**: Modify the Vite configuration to enable debug mode for the console redirection plugin:
   ```javascript
   // vite.config.js
   plugins: [
     vsixPlugin(),
     consoleRedirectPlugin({ debug: true }) // Enable debug mode
   ]
   ```

5. **Check for CORS Issues**: If you see CORS errors in the browser console, make sure the server is configured to allow cross-origin requests to the `/__console_redirect` endpoint.

## Conclusion

The console redirection feature should now be working correctly. If you continue to experience issues, please refer to the troubleshooting steps above or examine the console-redirect-plugin.js file for more detailed debugging information.
